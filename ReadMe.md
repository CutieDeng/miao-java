## UPDATE LOG

### 2021-05-14

#### Base version

Upload the original code file.

There are some emergent problems waiting to fix: 

1. The *Miao* Language is monotonous and immutable. It's not convenient to expand the program. 
2. The *Miao* can be added with some different punctuations, which can make the emotions abundant, and also can extract the information efficiently.
3. Encode the ASCII table. 

#### Add the ReadMe.md
